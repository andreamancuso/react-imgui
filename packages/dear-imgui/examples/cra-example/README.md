# Just a sample CRA app

Nothing better than a working example on how to use the React-WASM libraries. Please note, React versions (library's and application's) must match. If you get strange errors (such as useRef being `null`), try running `npm ls react`, inspect the ouput, double-check that you do not have multiple versions of React.
