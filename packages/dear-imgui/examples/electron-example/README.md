# Electron example

I have followed [these instructions](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/framework-integration/react-with-typescript).

Sadly I ran into issue when trying to build a Windows installer using electron forge so I switched to electron builder

The steps to build a package are

-   `npm run package`
-   `npm run make`
-   open the `dist` folder
